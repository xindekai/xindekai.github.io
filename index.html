      <h3>Care, Hope for my Family</h3>
      <p>My daughter was born in 2007 with a rare, not inherited, chromosomal disorder. This has resulted in her suffering from global developmental delay, autistic behaviour, motor coordination issues and other profoundly life impacting effects. I have been her primary carer since she came into this world, broken and an unlikely survivor. Over eleven years she has taught me far more than I have her, but she loves me and that is more than I could hope for.</p>
