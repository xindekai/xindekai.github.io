      <h3>Care for my Daughter, Hope for my Family</h3>
      <p>My daughter Ildiko was born in 2007 with a rare, not inherited, chromosomal disorder. This has resulted in her suffering from global developmental delay, autistic behaviour, motor coordination issues and other profoundly life impacting effects. I have been her primary carer since she came into this world, broken and an unlikely survivor. Over eleven years she has taught me far more than I have her, but she loves me and that is more than I could hope for.</p>

      <p>Before becoming a father, I have two other children, healthy boys, I led the life of an itinerant poet. Radical literature and alternative social and artistic communities filled my life with travel and creation. I met my wife, the artist Diamond Frances, and since 2005 we have transitioned into a family with a severly disabled child for whom we are responsible. Over a decade that change has impacted all areas of our lives and careers. It has led to this point, where my wife is changing her role to primary carer and I am seeking to re-enter the workforce by retraining at age forty-five as a web developer. The barriers to this seem immense but we are hopeful.</p>
