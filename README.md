I am really excited about Founders and Coders but don't know if I'll make the requirements in time for the next intake. I'm working really hard to get my website in this repo up and running by (this!) Friday. It's the last piece of the application puzzle I have left to do.

Even if I don't make the Founders and Coders intake it has been a real and fun challenge just working towards it.

A great program of study I am slowly working through.

I love the rigour and seriousness of OSSU CS as well as its commitment to opensource social values. I hope I do well on it and learn lots.

I am tracking my progress with [Trello](https://trello.com/b/YK4FeoPy/ossu-computer-science-curriculum).
