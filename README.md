A great program of study I am slowly working through.

I love the rigour and seriousness of OSSU CS as well as its commitment to opensource social values. I hope I do well on it and learn lots.

I am tracking my progress with [Trello](https://trello.com/b/YK4FeoPy/ossu-computer-science-curriculum).
